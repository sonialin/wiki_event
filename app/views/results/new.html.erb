  <dl>
    <dt>The searchable date range is from 01/01/2000 till today.</dt>
    <dd>The more recent, the more reliable. Wikipedia earlier than 2010 appears prone to inconsistent markup and missing dates in the event section.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt>Search on the same date will be cached locally.</dt>
    <dd>An edit made on Wikipedia for an already searched date won't be reflected locally.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt>In the event that no events were obtained, or any parts of the events were missing for the day, the query is saved to indicate the attempted retrieval.</dt>
    <dd>For example, event summary will be 'n/a', or no events will be saved if no events are retrived for the date.</dd>
